Unofficial Updater 2

Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Unofficial Updater 2 is an outgrowth of the frustration that came 
from trying to manually patch ColdFusion 8.0.1 with the numerous 
hot fixes and security bulletins that have been published. It is a tool 
to provide an easy way of consistently applying applicable hot fixes 
and security bulletins to ColdFusion 8.0.1.

Unofficial Updater 2 is NOT endorsed by or have any ties to Adobe. 

Use of Unofficial Updater 2 is at your own risk.

** Please make sure the ColdFusion Server/process IS NOT running before 
using Unofficial Updater 2. **

What it does
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
First it asks specific questions about how ColdFusion is installed. It 
will then produce backups of any directories it will modify. Finally it 
will download the applicable hot fixes and security bulletins from Adobe 
and apply them according to the published instructions. It only updates 
files, it will NOT modify any settings (jvm.config, registry, etc).

Details
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
At the core, Unofficial Updater 2 is just an Ant script. Ant was chosen 
since it could provide cross platform support. The ant script was 
wrapped with AntInstaller to create a GUI and text based interface which
only require Java 1.5+ to be installed.  

All hot fixes and security bulletins published as of April 18, 2011 are 
applied except for the following:
 * kb404026 - Patch for Performance Monitor with ColdFusion 8.0.1
  - http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/404/kb404026.html
 * CVE-2009-1876 - wsconfig.jar update for Apache
  - http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb09-12.html
 * kb403750 - Using the flexgateway to instantiate multiple instances of 
              CFCs causes objects to be populated as nulls (hf801-71643)
  - http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/403/kb403750.html

Both kb404026 and CVE-2009-1876 require modifications to be done to the 
system configuration. kb404026 requires ability to modify the Windows 
registry and CVE-2009-1876 will modify the connector configuration. 
kb403750 is not installed since it does not seem to resolve all the issues
and breaks other things, see

Unofficial Updater 2 DOES apply APSB11-04. Please refer to the technote 
about the Session Fixation issue since Unofficial Updater 2 does not 
modify jvm.config.
